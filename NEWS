 * Portability: fixed Windows incompatibility bug. Handling of Ctrl-C
   may or may not work on Windows, depending on console.
 * Added quipperi script, analogous to ghci.
 * New library QuipperLib.ClassicalOptim: algebraic optimization of
   auto-generated classical circuits. Added "optimized" oracle to BWT
   algorithm.
 * QuipperLib.Decompose: Added decomposition into a "standard" gate
   set, consisting of X, Y, Z, H, S, S-dagger, T, T-dagger, and CNOT.
   Added KeepPhase flag to some transformers.
 * QuipperLib.GateDecompositions: added more gates.
 * New library Libraries.Synthesis.RotationDecomposition: implements a
   variant of the algorithm from Nielsen and Chuang to decompose an
   nxn unitary operator into one- and two-level rotations.
 * New library QuipperLib.Unboxing: unboxing transformers.
 * Updated ASCII output format; improved circuit parser efficiency.
 * Miscellaneous bug fixes: malformed W-gates, qdata_of_qubits,
